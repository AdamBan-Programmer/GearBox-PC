# GearBox
It's a basic driver for gamepads. You can make your own gearbox using simple and cheap gamepad. This application allows you to calibrate your gamepad to set single gears easly. If you don't want to buy original gearbox, this app will help you to enjoy a game like in real car. This app works great with Euro Truck Simulator 2.

# About:
- I created this app to add a simple gearbox into a game without spending a lot of money. It makes a game more similar to real car. I used a JINPUT library to detect and implement controllers into app. I used basic java packages like Swing and Robot as well. I decided to store profiles and settings in local files by serialization.

# How to use: 
1. Create new profile.
2. Add configs and calibrate them. You can set name your of your config and set activation range. You can create many binds to activate one config. Don't forget to set value passed to the game. You can create as many configs as you need. To open calibration window click onto config button. To remove config use double-click on config button.
4. Select gamepad which you want to use.
5. Always you can rename or remove your profile.
6. To apply changes remember to click "Save Profile"!
7. You can use 'run: Euro Truck Simulator 2' button to start a game instantly. Firstly you have to set a path to a Euro Truck Simulator 2.exe or to a shortcut in Settings.
8. To start. Select your profile and click 'START'
